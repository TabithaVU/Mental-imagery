The current project is visualizing the association of areas in the brain with mental imagery, using existing fMRI data from 84 studies. We created a figure that highlights voxels that were associated with mental imagery. In addition, we created a histogram to show how intensely these voxels were associated with mental imagery.  

### Table of content: 
- The fMRI data about mental imagery was downloaded from [Neurosynth.org]  (https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/mental%20imagery/)
- The file called "imagery.ipynb" is the notebook that contains all the code for the visualization.

### Python packages 
The python packages that were used in the current project are the following: 
- plotting from nilearn
- nibabel
- pyplot from matplotlib
- numpy
